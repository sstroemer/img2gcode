# img2gcode
Generates a gcode (especially for 3D printers) from a given image that represents a positive/negative that is actually printable and "comes close to the image". That means respecting the printers min/max sizes (especially nozzle size, layer height, different extrusion widths, ...). Can be used as simple positive image (or like a stamp) or as negative for (oil based) monoprints.
